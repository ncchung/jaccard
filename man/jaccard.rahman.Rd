\title{Compute p-value using the EC-BLAST method}
\usage{
jaccard.rahman(j)
}
\arguments{
\item{j}{a numeric vector of observed Jaccard coefficients (uncentered)}
}
\value{
\code{jaccard.rahman} returns a numeric vector of p-values
}
\description{
In the EC-BLAST paper, Rahman et al. (2014) provide the following description:
The mean (μ) and s.d. (σ) of the similarity scores are used to
define the z score, z = (Tw – μ)/σ. For the purpose of calculating
the P value, only hits with T > 0 are considered. The P value w
is derived from the z score using an extreme value distribution 
P = 1 – exp(−e−zπ/√(6) − Γ′ (1)), where the Euler-Mascheroni constant Γ′ (1) ≈ 0.577215665.
